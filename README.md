# Auto-Saving-Piggy-Bank-Self-Growing-Wallet-
A decentralized piggy bank smart contract that lets the owner deposit ETH, which stays locked for 30 days. After the lock period, the owner can withdraw the amount with simple interest. It also includes an emergency withdrawal option that allows the owner to take out funds anytime without earning interest.
